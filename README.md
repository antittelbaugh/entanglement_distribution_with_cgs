# Data of the cut graph states experiments
This repository holds the data to reproduce the plots in the paper [Scaling quantum computing with dynamic circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17833).
In more details, the repository contains the following:

* Stabilizer data
* Notebooks to plot the data
* Circuits (serialized with QPY) and their associated parameter values to create one, two, and three cut Bell pairs
